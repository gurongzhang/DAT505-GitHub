# DAT505-Session3
## Introduction:
#### This session introduced the concept of GUI(Graphical User Interface). From my understanding, GUI means users can change different values on the user interface directly instead of changing them in the code sources. What is more, we did our own creative GUI projects based on what we learned:
  * ### GUI
  * ### Controller(Scale, Position, Rotation, Color, Opacity)
  * ### Color converter
## S3-ClassExamples-00-BasicStructure-GUI: *Cube(scale,position,rotation)*
#### This is one example which shows one Cube that can change its rotation, position and scale.

### Knowledge Points
  1. To use GUI, one line of code that shows the script source containing the _**dat.gui.min.js** file_ must be added to the _**index.html** file_.
  ```javascript
    <script src="js/dat.gui.min.js"></script>
  ```
     Meanwhile, the _**dat.gui.min.js** file_ should be copied to the _**js** file_ too.
